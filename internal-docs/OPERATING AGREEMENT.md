10.3 Third-Party Agreements Amendments required to comply with third-party contracts (such as loan agreements or lease agreements) may be made at the Member's sole discretion.

ARTICLE 11: COMPLIANCE AND LIABILITY PROTECTION

11.1 Maintenance of Limited Liability The Member acknowledges that the primary benefit of the LLC structure is limited liability protection. To maintain this protection, the Member agrees to:

    Keep the Company's finances completely separate from personal finances

    Maintain separate bank accounts in the Company's name

    File all required annual reports and tax returns on time

    Pay the annual Maryland Personal Property Return fee (currently $300, due by April 15)

    Maintain adequate business insurance

    Comply with all Maryland LLC statutory requirements

    Follow this Operating Agreement's procedures for decision-making and financial management

11.2 Personal Liability Limitations Notwithstanding the above, the Member acknowledges that certain personal acts may pierce the corporate veil, including:

    Personally committing negligent acts in the course of the Company's business

    Using Company assets for personal benefit

    Misrepresenting the Company's financial status to creditors or investors

    Failing to pay employee payroll taxes

11.3 Insurance The Member shall obtain and maintain appropriate business insurance for the Company on the following schedule:

Phase One (Within 12 months of Effective Date):

The Member shall obtain and maintain Professional Liability Insurance (Errors & Omissions) covering web development services with a minimum coverage limit of $1,000,000 per occurrence. Professional Liability Insurance is the priority coverage for the Company's core web development business and shall be obtained no later than twelve (12) months following the Effective Date of this Agreement.

Phase Two (Within 24 months of Effective Date):

In addition to Phase One coverage, the Member shall obtain and maintain Cyber Liability Insurance to cover data breaches, unauthorized access, malware, ransomware, and cyber attacks on Company systems and client websites. This coverage shall be obtained no later than twenty-four (24) months following the Effective Date of this Agreement. Cyber Liability Insurance becomes increasingly important as the Company acquires additional clients and expands its service offerings.

Phase Three (Within 36 months of Effective Date):

In addition to Phase One and Phase Two coverage, the Member shall obtain and maintain General Liability Insurance covering bodily injury and property damage to third parties. This coverage shall be obtained no later than thirty-six (36) months following the Effective Date of this Agreement and shall provide comprehensive protection as the Company matures and expands its operations.

Workers' Compensation Insurance:

The Member shall obtain and maintain Workers' Compensation Insurance as required by Maryland law if and when the Company hires W-2 employees. Workers' Compensation Insurance is not required for independent contractors or freelancers engaged by the Company.

Rationale for Phased Approach:

The Member acknowledges that the phased approach to insurance coverage reflects the realistic financial constraints of a bootstrapped business while ensuring adequate protection of the Company's core professional liability risk. Professional Liability (Phase One) is prioritized as it directly protects against claims regarding the quality and professional nature of web development work. Cyber Liability (Phase Two) becomes increasingly important as the Company's client base expands and the volume of sensitive client data increases. General Liability (Phase Three) provides additional comprehensive protection as the Company matures and expands its operations and may establish physical office space.

Flexibility for Earlier Implementation:

The Member may, at his discretion, implement any Phase Two or Phase Three coverage earlier than the deadlines specified above if business circumstances, revenue increases, or client requirements make earlier implementation feasible and desirable. Acceleration of coverage timelines is encouraged as business performance permits.

Certificate of Insurance:

For all insurance policies obtained, the Member shall maintain current Certificates of Insurance on file and shall provide copies to clients upon request. The Member shall notify clients of the insurance coverage available and shall provide access to Certificates of Insurance as part of the professional service offering, demonstrating the Company's commitment to client protection.

Annual Review and Adjustment:

This insurance schedule shall be reviewed annually on the anniversary of the Effective Date to assess whether earlier implementation of Phase Two or Phase Three coverage is feasible and prudent. If the Company's annual revenue exceeds $50,000, the Member shall prioritize obtaining Phase Two (Cyber Liability) coverage even if the twenty-four (24) month deadline has not yet been reached.

Maintenance of Liability Protection:

The Member acknowledges that the phased implementation of insurance coverage, combined with maintenance of separate Company finances, timely tax filings, and compliance with all requirements set forth in Section 11.1, shall satisfy the insurance requirements necessary to maintain the Company's limited liability protection under Maryland law.

11.4 Compliance with Laws The Company shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, including:

    Tax laws and regulations

    Employment laws and wage requirements

    Data protection and privacy laws (including GDPR, CCPA)

    Accessibility laws (ADA compliance for websites)

    Consumer protection laws

    Intellectual property laws

ARTICLE 12: DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION

12.1 Voluntary Dissolution The Company may be voluntarily dissolved by the Member at any time by filing Articles of Dissolution with the State of Maryland and providing written notice to all creditors and stakeholders.

12.2 Termination Events The Company shall be dissolved upon the occurrence of:

    The Member's voluntary decision to dissolve

    The Member's death (assets pass to estate unless Member directs continuation)

    Forfeiture of the Company's LLC status due to non-compliance with Maryland law

    Entry of a final judgment of dissolution by a court of competent jurisdiction

12.3 Liquidation Process Upon dissolution, the Company's assets shall be liquidated in the following order of priority:

    Payment of all debts and liabilities of the Company

    Payment of all costs and expenses of liquidation

    Payment of all federal, state, and local taxes owed

    Distribution of remaining assets to the Member

12.4 Liquidation Valuation All assets shall be valued at their fair market value as of the date of dissolution. Assets may be sold, distributed in kind, or retained by the Member at fair market value.

12.5 No Unwinding of Client Work The Member acknowledges that upon dissolution, the Company's client contracts may terminate or require transition. The Member shall make commercially reasonable efforts to effect orderly transition of client work and ensure client intellectual property is transferred as required by client agreements.

ARTICLE 13: DISPUTE RESOLUTION

13.1 Internal Disputes As this is a single-member LLC, internal disputes are not anticipated. However, if questions arise regarding the interpretation of this Agreement, such questions shall be resolved by the Member in consultation with appropriate legal counsel.

13.2 Disputes with Third Parties Any disputes between the Company and third parties (including clients, contractors, or service providers) shall be resolved according to the terms of the applicable contract with the third party, or if no such terms exist, through negotiation, mediation, or litigation as appropriate.

13.3 Governing Law This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, without regard to conflicts of law principles.

13.4 Venue Any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, and the Member consents to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Articles of Organization, the Articles of Organization shall control to the extent required by Maryland law.

14.3 Waiver No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced. No waiver of any breach shall constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
