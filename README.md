To ensure maximum performance and SEO, we chose a modern, developer-centric stack:

* **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**: A web framework designed for speed. We utilize Astro’s "Islands Architecture" to ship zero client-side JavaScript by default, ensuring lightning-fast load times.
* **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: The powerhouse runtime environment that handles our build processes and server-side logic.
* **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows us to build a custom, high-contrast design system with "poppy" visuals.
